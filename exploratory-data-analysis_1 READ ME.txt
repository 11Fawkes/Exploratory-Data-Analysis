# 🌍 Pollution Monitoring & Analysis – EDA Project  

## 🚀 Overview  
This project is designed to **analyze and track pollution levels across Germany**, focusing on **air and noise pollution**.  
It integrates **real-time satellite data** from **Sentinel Hub API** and datasets from the **European Environment Agency**  
to identify **major pollution sources** and their environmental impact.

## 🔎 What Does This Project Measure?  
✔ **Air Pollution** – Tracks major pollutants like **NO₂, CO, SO₂, and PM2.5** from industrial, traffic, and environmental sources.  
✔ **Noise Pollution** – Monitors **sound levels from various sources**, including **airplanes, railways, highways, and urban zones**.  
✔ **Regional Impact** – Maps pollution hotspots and identifies **which areas are most affected**.  

## 📊 Data Sources & Collection  
📌 **Satellite Data** – **Sentinel-5P API** provides **real-time atmospheric pollution data**.  
📌 **Government Datasets** – Includes **renewable energy impact and urban pollution metrics** from EU agencies.  
📌 **Noise Monitoring Data** – Collected from urban centers and transit routes (**trains, airports, highways**).  

## 🛠 Methods Used  
⚡ **Geospatial Analysis** – Uses **geoJSON mapping** to visualize pollution intensity.  
⚡ **Time Series Analysis** – Tracks pollution trends over time.  
⚡ **Comparative Analysis** – Identifies **which areas contribute most** to pollution.  

## 📂 What’s Inside?  
📊 **Data Extracts & Reports** – Ready-to-use datasets for further analysis.  
📜 **Code & Scripts** – Python scripts for **data preprocessing, visualization, and API interactions**.  
📉 **Pollution Monitoring Dashboard** – **Power BI & Jupyter-based visualizations** for trend analysis.
